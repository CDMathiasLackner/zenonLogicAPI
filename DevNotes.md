# zenonApi.Xml
## Purpose
The purpose of this API is to wrap the zenon editor api for better and safer use than the existing COM offers.
## Getting started
In order to continue work, this state requieres you to fetch and reference three projects from the current PS devops. 

- $/Global/HQ/Projects/InternalTools/AuthorIt/DocToolXmlGenerator/TfsFolderPathResolver
- $/Global/HQ/Projects/InternalTools/AuthorIt/DynPropertyParser
- $/Global/hq/Projects/InternalTools/AuthorIt/DocToolXmlGenerator/Ait6Supplemental
  - I tried using the nuget but it did not work as the DynPropParser as of now requieres the version 6th of AuthorIt.
